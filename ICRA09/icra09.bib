@article{Gillespie:2007p1788,
author = {Daniel T Gillespie},
journal = {Annual Review of Physical Chemistry},
title = {Stochastic simulation of chemical kinetics},
abstract = {Stochastic chemical kinetics describes the time evolution of a well-stirred chemically reacting system in a way that takes into account the fact that molecules come in whole numbers and exhibit some degree of randomness in their dynamical behavior. Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale SSA.},

The solutions of these parametric programming problems are studied for the case of linear kinetics and turn out to be not unique in every case. The investigations are confined to stationary states. The net flux through the chain is considered a fixed parameter. The optimality criteria concern the osmotic pressure caused by the intermediates, various relaxation times, largest time scale, and controllability. They all yield distinct time hierarchies. The influence of a constraint concerning the sum of intermediate concentrations is studied. Various combinations of the single criteria are treated as multiobjective programming problems.},

A theoretical framework is developed, which is based upon the rich and deep formalism of irreducible biochemical networks. When represented in this manner, the mass action kinetics of biochemical processes can be clearly seen in terms of their component biochemical interactions, their kinetic rate constants, and the stoichiometry for the system. A minimal parametrization is provided for models for two- or multi-state receptor interaction with ligand, and an "affinity quotient" is introduced, which allows an elegant classification of ligands into agonists, neutral agonists, and inverse agonists.},

title = {Exploring the parameter space of complex self-assembly through virus capsid models},
abstract = {We use discrete event stochastic simulations to characterize the parameter space of a model of icosahedral viral capsid assembly as functions of monomer-monomer binding rates. The simulations reveal a parameter space characterized by three major assembly mechanisms, a standard nucleation-limited monomer-accretion pathway and two distinct hierarchical assembly pathways, as well as unproductive regions characterized by kinetically trapped species. Much of the productive parameter space also consists of border regions between these domains where hybrid pathways are likely to operate. A simpler octamer system studied for comparison reveals three analogous pathways, but is characterized by much lesser sensitivity to parameter variations in contrast to the sharp changes visible in the icosahedral model. The model suggests that modest changes in assembly conditions, consistent with expected differences between in vitro and in vivo assembly environments, could produce substantial shifts in assembly pathways. These results suggest that we must be cautious in drawing conclusions about in vivo capsid self-assembly dynamics from theoretical or in vitro models, as the nature of the basic assembly mechanisms accessible to a system can substantially differ between simple and complex model systems, between theoretical models and simulation results, and between in vitro and in vivo assembly conditions.},

title = {Probability-based model of protein-protein interactions on biological timescales},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Simulation methods can assist in describing and understanding complex networks of interacting proteins, providing fresh insights into the function and regulation of biological systems. Recent studies have investigated such processes by explicitly modelling the diffusion and interactions of individual molecules. In these approaches, two entities are considered to have interacted if they come within a set cutoff distance of each other. RESULTS: In this study, a new model of bimolecular interactions is presented that uses a simple, probability-based description of the reaction process. This description is well-suited to simulations on timescales relevant to biological systems (from seconds to hours), and provides an alternative to the previous description given by Smoluchowski. In the present approach (TFB) the diffusion process is explicitly taken into account in generating the probability that two freely diffusing chemical entities will interact within a given time interval. It is compared to the Smoluchowski method, as modified by Andrews and Bray (AB). CONCLUSION: When implemented, the AB {\&} TFB methods give equivalent results in a variety of situations relevant to biology. Overall, the Smoluchowski method as modified by Andrews and Bray emerges as the most simple, robust and efficient method for simulating biological diffusion-reaction processes currently available.},
